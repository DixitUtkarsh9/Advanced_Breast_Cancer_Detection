# Advanced Breast Cancer Detection

## Overview
This project focuses on developing an advanced breast cancer prediction model using machine learning techniques. The model leverages the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to achieve high accuracy in breast cancer detection.

## Features
- **Machine Learning Model:** Implemented a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performed detailed analysis to understand data distributions and key features.
- **High Accuracy:** Achieved **97% accuracy** in detecting breast cancer.

## Dataset
- The dataset contains medical features and diagnostic labels for breast cancer detection.
- Preprocessing steps include handling missing values, feature scaling, and data normalization.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Breast-Cancer-Detection.git
cd Breast-Cancer-Detection

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To train and evaluate the model, run the following script:

```bash
python train_svm.py
```

To make a prediction:

```bash
python predict.py --input data/sample_input.csv
```

## Results
